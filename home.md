## Course Description

What does it mean to conduct research in computer science, and how might we be most effective at it?
To help you begin a fruitful career in CS research, this class will cover the philosophy and practice of forming ideas, executing research, presenting outcomes, and more broadly understanding and contributing to our community. 
This class also aims to kick-start your time at Brown CS by being the 'missing semester' on _how to be a PhD student_, and by peeling back the curtain on _why CS academia works like this_ to help you make the most of your time. 

Discussions will include: 
- motivating, pitching, and funding research; 
- finding, reading, and reviewing research; 
- selecting research areas and forming hypotheses; 
- designing, performing, and evaluating research; 
- communicating research;
- research collaborations; and 
- research ethics.

We will learn together through presentations, activities, and discussions in class time, along with readings and assignments out of class.

### Prerequisites

None.

### Time Commitment

Total time spent in and out of class for this course is estimated at 180 hours. Over the 15 weeks of this course, students will spend two and a half hours in class each week (or 37.5 hours total). Although specific out‐of‐class time investments may vary for individual students, a reasonable estimate to support this course's learning outcomes is 142 total out‐of class hours, or on average, about 9.5 hours weekly over a 15‐week term. Out‐of‐class preparation will regularly include about 2‐4 hours per class of reading (about 50 hours total). In addition to this ongoing preparation time, students are expected to allocate about 80 hours over the course of the term to work on the assignments. Additionally, roughly 10‐15 hours will be spent preparing a short presentation in class, performed by different students each week.

### Reading References

There is no requirement to buy a textbook. The goal of the course is to be self contained, but sections from three textbooks will be suggested for more formalization and information. Two of these books are available free online, with the third available online through Brown's library.

## General Policy

### Welcome!

Our intent is that this course provide a welcoming environment for all students. All members of the CS community, including faculty, students, and staff, are expected to treat one another in a professional manner. If you feel you have not been treated in a professional manner by any of the course staff, please contact Ugur Cetintemel (Dept. Chair), Tom Doeppner (Vice Chair), or Laura Dobler (diversity and inclusion staff member). We will take all complaints about unprofessional behavior seriously. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let James know of ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups. To access student support services and resources, and to learn more about diversity and inclusion in CS, please visit [http://cs.brown.edu/about/diversity/resources/](http://cs.brown.edu/about/diversity/resources/).

Prof. Krishnamurthi has [good notes](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/2016/professionalism.html) on this area.

### Quiet Hours

This class runs _quiet hours_ from 7pm to 9am every day. Please do not expect a response from us via any channel. Likewise, we won't ask you to do anything between these times, either, like handing in projects.

### Academic Integrity, Collaboration, and Citation

Please discuss the concepts in the course with your colleagues and friends, and feel free to work through the ideas and problems together. Please write your own project deliverables.

Brown-wide, academic dishonesty is not tolerated. This includes cheating, lying about course matters, plagiarism, or helping others commit a violation. Plagiarism includes reproducing the words of others without both the use of quotation marks and citation. Students are reminded of the obligations and expectations associated with the Brown Academic and Student Conduct Codes.

### Accommodations

Brown University is committed to full inclusion of all students. Please inform the professor(s) if you have a disability or other condition that might require accommodations or modification of any of these course procedures. You may email the professor(s), come to professor office hours, or speak after class, and your confidentiality is respected. We will do whatever we can to support accommodations recommended by Student Accessibility Services (SAS). For more information contact [Student Accessibility Services (SAS)](https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/accessibility-services/) at 401-863-9588 or <a href="#" class="cryptedmail"
    title="Email to contact SAS, click to send email"
    data-name="SEAS"
    data-domain="brown"
    data-tld="edu"
    onclick="window.location.href = 'mailto:' + this.dataset.name + '@' + this.dataset.domain + '.' + this.dataset.tld; return false;"></a>. 
Students in need of short-term academic advice or support can contact one of the deans in the Dean of the College office.

### Mental Health

Being a student can be very stressful. If you feel you are under too much pressure or there are psychological issues that are keeping you from performing well at Brown, we encourage you to contact [Brown's Counseling and Psychological Services](https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/counseling-and-psychological-services/). They provide confidential counseling and can provide notes supporting extensions on assignments for health reasons.

Additionally, the [Brown CS Health and Wellness Advocates](https://browncs-health-and-wellness.github.io) also offer resources and office hours for students.

### Incomplete Policy

We expect everyone to complete the course on time. However, we understand that there may be factors beyond your control, such as health problems and family crises, that prevent you from finishing the course on time. If you feel you cannot complete the course on time, please discuss with the professor(s) the possibility of being given a grade of Incomplete for the course and setting a schedule for completing the course in the upcoming year.

### Electronic Etiquette

Laptop use is discouraged, please, except for class-relevant activities, e.g., to view lecture or to help answer questions and show items relevant to discussion. No social media, email, etc., because it distracts not just you but other students as well. Read Shirky on this issue (["Why I Just Asked My Students to Put Their Laptops Away"](https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368)), or Rockmore (["The Case for Banning Laptops in the Classroom"](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-case-for-banning-laptops-in-the-classroom)).

We will release course lecture material online. In considering laptop use for note taking, please be aware that research has shown note taking on paper can be more efficient than on a laptop keyboard ([Mueller and Oppenheimer](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614524581)), as it pushes you to summarize the content instead of transcribe it.

<section id="feedback-section">

## Feedback

We would appreciate any feedback on how to improve the course. We have created [an anonymous form to collect feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScw3iKW4ggkWhjqv6EnibBZyGDT7af-6RixKxN9EZejs-RWaw/viewform), which is accessible through your Brown Google account (but we do not collect your identity). We will read the feedback every two weeks at grading. If there is something more urgent (and not anonymous), please email the professor(s) or the course staff. If there is something urgent and anonymous, please consider contacting one of the parties listed in the general policy.
